Those effects are available on our test server.
Simply connect to test server, write any number between 0 and 303 in chat, and shoot the weapon.

After finding the effect you like, remember its name and simply search for that name in ice_test/ice_test.py or effects/es_effects.txt.
Tip, if being lazy just search recursively all folders ;-)


The effects are coded in ES or Python, but can be 'recoded' with moderate effort using visual.sp plugin
