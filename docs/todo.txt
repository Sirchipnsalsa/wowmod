multi server talk:
table with 3 columns.
autoincrement serv_id message

on startup localIncr = maxIncr

each 10 sec all servers grab info with WHERE incr > localIncr.
localIncr is = incr last time obtained.
ignore own messages!

each minute main server removes messages with autoIncr < localIncr - 100
So the table will have last 100 messages (will become boggus of people send more than 100 messages per 10 sec
which is impossible anyway, number can be increased anyway)

This system will easely support as many servers as needed instead of limited.


Recode hp system to have 0-100
Recode boss system to lock round end

Add taunt
add new spell for each class?
